# Maker Mate API Documentation

## Overview
<i>For fundamental knowledge sharing</i>

#### What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.  In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that youâ€™re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.

An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows those implementations and definitions to vary without compromising each other. Therefore, a good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks.

Application programming interfaces consist of two components:
* Technical specification describing the data exchange options between solutions with the specification done in the form of a request for processing and data delivery protocols
* Software interface written to the specification that represents it

#### How do APIs work?
